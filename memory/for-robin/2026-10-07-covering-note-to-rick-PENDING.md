# PENDING EMAIL — to Rick, CC Robin (send in next wake/comms session)

**Why pending:** the 2026-10-07 WRITE session rules forbid email; this covering note
(mandated by WRITE.md / PROTOCOL §2) is drafted here for the wake session to send.
The re-review is what re-earns the clean peer-review grade on `tangent-uniqueness-spoly`.

**To:** grandparick20@gmail.com
**CC:** langer.robin@gmail.com (mandatory)
**Subject:** Re: container-derivative rewrite — all referee corrections applied (U + E), commit 19e372d

Rick,

Thanks for the careful report (UID 206). All of it is applied, pushed at commit **19e372d**
on `scotmacbeth/work-in-progress`. Both notes recompile clean (U 15pp, E 10pp).

**U (uniqueness):**
- U1 — the whole note now lives in `Lin(SPoly)` ≃ the finite-rank part of `FreeMod_N`
  (morphisms = N-matrices, ◁ = matrix composition). The augmentation ε↦0 is a legitimate
  matrix morphism there, so the fibre count |P'| = 1+n+n² is honest; S·y is a morphism, not
  an object-tensor.
- U2/U3 — solidity is now "vertical lift ℓ_M : M→M⊗M is iso". The two false sentences
  ("M=y solid", "μ iso in each case") are gone; Lemma 8 / Thm 9 go through on the abstract
  iso M⊗M≅M alone.
- S2 — deleted the "base change = p(y+εv) mod ε²" claim; base change sends y²↦y², the
  substitution is the ⊗W⊣Kähler unit and a non-linear p isn't in the module category.
- S7 — the "linearity forced" paragraph is gone (automatic in FreeMod_N).
- S3/S6 — existence of T=(−)⊗W now cited to Cockett–Cruttwell, not E.
- **U8 — I ran it, and it closes P (your suggestion was right, and stronger).** The flip
  cℓ=ℓ with ℓ_M iso forces c = id on the mixed part (so c is NOT the swap for rank ≥ 2 —
  your caveat's "non-representable" variant is the *only* option, not an escape), and
  lift-coassociativity then forces ℓ_M diagonal ⟹ rank ≤ 1 at every cardinality. So ℕ·y is
  solid but not a tangent structure; "finiteness is sharp" is withdrawn and uniqueness is now
  rank-free. Proof file `proofs/2026-10-07-u8-flip-closes-f4.md`; the note cites it as
  [MacBethFlip] and gives the reason in one sentence + a footnote, not the full chain.

**E (existence):** "finitary" → "finite-support" throughout; the DCont-restriction is
relabelled a proposition-sketch (comonoid-preservation computed, not proved); recompiled with
a fresh date. Your `[5, Prop. 4.7]` query — that's CC2014 Prop 4.7 (every CDC is a Cartesian
tangent category), correct as cited.

I did not touch the registry grade — I'll leave the peer-review stamp for your re-review.

MacBeth
